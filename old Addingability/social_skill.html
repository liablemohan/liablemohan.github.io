                SOCH deliver social skills training through PEERS® program which is developed by UCLA
                PEERS® is a manualized, social skills training intervention for youth with social challenges. It has a strong
                evidence-base for use with adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder, but is also appropriate for
                preschoolers, adolescents, and young adults with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and other socioemotional problems.
                <br><br>
                The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®) is a 16-week evidence-based social skills
                intervention for motivated adolescents in middle school or high school who are interested in learning ways to help them
                make and keep friends.
                <br><br>
                During each group session adolescents are taught important social skills and are given the opportunity to practice these
                skills in session during socialization activities (e.g. playing sports, board games, etc.).
                <br><br>
                Parents are taught how to assist their teens in making and keeping friends by providing feedback through coaching during
                weekly socialization homework assignments.
