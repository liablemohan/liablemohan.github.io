                <p style="font-size: larger;">If you think that your child is not developing at the same pace or in the same way as most children his or her age, it
                is often a good idea to talk first to a specialist. Explain your concerns. Tell the specialist what you have observed
                with your child. Your child may have a developmental delay, or he or she may be at risk of having a delay. <br> <br>
                 <b>
                The term “developmental delay” means that a child is delayed in some area of development. There are five areas in which
                development may be affected:
                </b> <ul>
               <li>-Cognitive development including understanding and talking</li>
               <li>-Physical development, including vision and hearing</li>
               <li>-Communication development including speech</li>
               <li>-Social or emotional development including behaviour</li>
               <li>-Adaptive development including play and engagement</li>
                </ul>
<br><br>
                <b>
                Early intervention is a system of services that helps children with developmental delays. Early intervention focuses on
                helping to learn the basic and brand-new skills such as:
            </b>
            <ul>
                <li>-physical (reaching, rolling, crawling, and walking);</li>
                <li>-cognitive (thinking, learning, solving problems);</li>
                <li>-communication (talking, listening, understanding);</li>
                <li>-social/emotional (playing, feeling secure and happy);</li>
                <li>-self-help (eating, dressing).</li>
                </ul>
                Early Intervention services include therapy from disciplines like occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech & language
                therapy, psychology and special education. The therapies will be tailored to meet the child’s individual needs.
