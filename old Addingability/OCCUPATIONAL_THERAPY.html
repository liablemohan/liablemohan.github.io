                occupational therapists help people across the lifespan participate in the things they want and need to do through the
                therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children
                with disabilities to participate fully in school and social
                situations, helping people recovering from injury to regain skills, and providing supports for older adults
                experiencing physical and cognitive changes.
                <br><br><br>
                Occupational therapy services may include comprehensive evaluations of the client’s home and other
                environments (e.g., workplace, school), recommendations for adaptive equipment and training in its use, and guidance and
                education for family members and caregivers.
                <br><br><br>
                Occupational therapy practitioners have a holistic perspective, in which the focus is on adapting the environment to fit
                the person, and the person is an integral part of the therapy team.

                Benefits Of Occupational Therapy For Children
                </b><br><br><br>
                Kids occupational therapy has numerous benefits. The therapy is used for a wide
                range of diseases and disorders and prepares the kids to lead healthy and normal
                life. Some of the benefits are as follows. <br>
                General Activities of Daily Life:
                The list starts with providing aid to the young ones facing difficulties in daily
                activities like brushing, dressing, toileting, writing, drawing, etc. The therapy helps
                develop these self-help skills in the children. <br>
                Sensory Processing Issues:
                It is generally observed that children with sensory processing issues are unable to
                synthesize information in the basic five senses i.e. sight, smell, touch, hear, and
                taste. These children may experience over-sensitivity, under-sensitivity, or both at
                different places like school, home, or anywhere. These kids often feel difficulty in
                paying attention and get distracted by a loud fire alarm and other such things. They
                also try to avoid recess and activities going on around them.
                Occupational therapy can help those young ones regain the skills and addresses the
                issue in a proper manner. <br>
                Kids with Cerebral Palsy:
                The occupational therapy is also beneficial for the ones suffering from cerebral
                palsy, muscular dystrophy, and other disorders in which the kid needs a
                wheelchair. The OT practitioner teaches the kid to use the wheelchair in a proper
                manner and come for the lunch, make for the class on time, get things out from
                their locker, and more.<br><br><br>
                
                Kids with Autistic Spectrum Disorder:
                Autism and SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder) are somewhat related
                but are not same. Kids with SPD may not suffer from autism, but the reverse may
                be true. The kid suffering from SPD has trouble communicating other people,
                limited play skills, less interest in activities, etc. The occupational therapy
                practitioner can help gain these skills by observing the child’s behavior and
                developing a plan for them. The OT uses different sets of methods and plans, and
                there is no such single ideal program. These may include activities to help with
                interaction, puzzles to develop coordination and awareness and more.
                Fine and Gross Motor Skills
                Gross motor skill involves the movement of muscles in arms, legs, etc. whereas
                fine muscle skills involve the use of small muscles in forearm and fingers. Kids
                having trouble with these skills may experience difficulty in walking, bicycling,
                and other. Occupational therapy can be used to deal with the condition and
                eventually eradicate it.
