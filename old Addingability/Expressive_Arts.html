                <p style="font-size: larger;">Expressive art is combination of dance, visual, arts, drama, music and communication. It enhances individual development
                and growth to improve overall well-being and contributes to lowering anxiety and stress, improving self awareness and
                self-esteem, strengthening relationships, regulating behaviors and advancing social skills. <br><br>

                Developmental Benefits of Expressive Art:</h1> <ul>
                    <li>Art is proven to have an impact on the brain’s neural connections, which acts as the wiring for learning and helps
                    children develop comprehensive thinking capabilities through the interaction of complex thought processes.</li>
                <li>Language Development: Children of all ages, both special needs and not, may not have the language skills to express
                themselves, but they still have a voice. Expressive arts awaken a child’s imagination and creativity to help him/her to
                discover who he/she is and how to engage his senses.</li>
               <li>Social Development: Expressive art therapy can enhance social development by providing support without judgment from
            peers, parents and therapists.</li>
               <li>Emotional Development: Expressive arts therapy can help children to develop and better understand their feelings. Being
            angry or hurt is not always easy to describe in words, but a child can put these emotions into a drawing, poem or dance.</li>
            <li>Physical Development: Improved motor skills and control, hand-eye coordination and muscle development can be achieved
            through different form of arts.</li>
            </ul>
