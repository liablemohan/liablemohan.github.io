                <p style="font-size: larger;">Cognitive development is the construction of thought processes, including remembering, problem solving, and
                decision-making, from childhood through adolescence to adulthood.
                <br><br>
                Cognitive development refers to how a person perceives, thinks, and gains understanding of his or her world through the
                interaction of genetic and learned factors. Among the areas of cognitive development are information processing,
                intelligence , reasoning, language development , and memory.
                <br><br>
                Cognitive impairment is the general loss or lack of development of cognitive abilities, particularly autism and learning
                disabilities. The National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) describes learning disabilities as a disorder that affects
                peopleâ€™s ability to either interpret what they see and hear or to link information from different parts of the brain.
                These limitations can show up in many ways, such as specific difficulties with spoken and written language,
                coordination, self-control, or attention. Such difficulties extend to schoolwork and can impede learning to read or
                write or to do math. A child who has a learning disability may have other conditions, such as hearing problems or
                serious emotional disturbance. However, learning disabilities are not caused by these conditions, nor are they caused by
                environmental influences such as cultural differences or inappropriate instruction.   </p>
